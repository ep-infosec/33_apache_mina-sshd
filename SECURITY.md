If you suspect you have found a security vulnerability in [Apache MINA sshd](./README.md)
code, please read the [Apache Software Foundation Security Policy](https://www.apache.org/security/)
for how to report the issue. Please do _not_ report the details publicly until the report
is reviewed and a fixed version has been published. More details are in the description
of the [ASF Security Vulnerability Process](https://www.apache.org/security/committers.html).
